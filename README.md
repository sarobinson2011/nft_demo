# nft_demo


### ToDo:

1. Can't view NFT image on goerli or looksrare - sort this out
                --> FIXED

2. Try this out on Sepolia 
                --> FIXED - deployed to Sepolia, viewable on OpenSea !!!

3. Write a new smart contract which RANDOMLY mints 10 unique NFTs           #ToDo
    ('Degen Doggos' collection of 5 - JACK, DASH, LAB, ROTTY, BERNY)



### Progress:

1. SimpleCollectible_OLD.sol working ^0.6.6 (openzeppelin @ 3.4.0)
2. IPFS installed
3. Images uploaded to IPFS
4. NFT deployed to goerli contract + successfully verified with publish_source=True
5. FIXED (1)  -->  URI was a link to the image, as opposed to a JSON file  - created pug.json, which links to the image .png file (now viewable)
