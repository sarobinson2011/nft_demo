# nft_demo

### Progress:

1. SimpleCollectible_OLD.sol working ^0.6.6 (openzeppelin @ 3.4.0)
2. IPFS installed
3. Images uploaded to IPFS
4. NFT deployed to goerli contract + successfully verified with publish_source=True

### ToDo:

1. Can't view NFT image on goerli or looksrare - sort this out
2. Once viewable, move on with video

  --> it's the metadata that's the problem??
 
3. Looks Rare didn't make a difference - try the metadata
